# Hangman

My version of the Hangman game in Javascript

Project accessible [here](https://fwauters.github.io/Hangman/)

Minimum working resolution = 300x480 px

I made a list of 36 random words for each difficulty, but you can add as many words as you want in the "settings_*difficulty*.js" files

*[Exercise](https://github.com/becodeorg/CRL-Woods-3.21/blob/master/LearningPath/02.The-Hill/11.Javascript/03.JS-Challenges/hangman/readme.md) I made for my formation with [BeCode](https://becode.org/)*
